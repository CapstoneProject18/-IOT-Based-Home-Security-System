# -IOT-Based-Home-Security-System
In this IoT based Project, we will build a Home Security System using PIR Sensor and PI Camera. This system will detect the presence of Intruder and quickly alert the user by sending him a alert mail. This mail will also contain the Picture of the Intruder, captured by Pi camera. Raspberry Pi is used to control the whole system
